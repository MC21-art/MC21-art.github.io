I am a first-year PhD student in theoretical Computer Science at IRIF, under the supervision of [Matthieu Picantin](https://www.irif.fr/~picantin/) and [Olivier Carton](https://www.irif.fr/~carton/). I work on Automata Theory, more specifically on decision problems of (semi)groups generated by Mealy automata.

Former maths student in University Paris Saclay, I graduated in 2025 with a Master’s degree in Theoretical Computer Science at the Université Paris Cité (MPRI).
